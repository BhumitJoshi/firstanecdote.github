Finally day arrives when I am going to embark on a new project of writing anecdote. Today I have to catch my train for Dehradun. Time to go back to college. You know what I missed the most about my college - food, yes and ever since my childhood I got to hear that the food of hostels is not palatable at all but in my case that is other way round. Well, At a very young age I have assimilated a habit of getting my things done prior to any event. So I packed my stuff a day before. I woke up at 5:00AM when the luminous sun light was streaming in through my window. Looking at the sun, wishing my journey to go great. At the right time I reached to the station. Got into the train, eager to know which seat I got. Thank God it was a window seat. Wheel started to rotate everything was going fine, but suddenly while thinking about my stuff a thought striked my mind which should have striked way before, that I forgot to bring my wallet. I often do not forget such things, and now I am a little bit nervous to what to do. I remain silent for few minutes externally but internally there were many thoughts hovering over my head, pondering about how am I supposed to get to my college with no money in my pocket. After a short span of time many ideas started springing up in my mind. But out of those ideas which I went for was -  Any shop nearby the station could lend me the money and Mom will Goggle pay him/her. Finally, I breathed a sign of relieve.<br>

 But this did not happen, I asked bhaiya sitting next to me to do this favour and he was happy to. I asked for 200 rupee. I thought 200 would be more than enough, but the things did not go the way it was expected. The train was running 1 hr. late therefore it took more 7hrs. to reach Dehradun station. I thought to hire a auto from station to college. I was surprised by hearing the cost. Every auto  was charging 200rupee, which was 10 times what I had paid to get here from my college. I preferred to wait for other autos but I canâ€™t saw any variation, the their charges. Eventually, After 15 minutes of waiting I got an auto which was heading towards my destination with 3 other passengers, I got into that auto, which costed me 100 rupee. Ultimately I reached college. Now something strange happens, while taking my out stuff, I found 2000Rupee, which I had kept safely before my first arrival to college....haha</p>

<p><strong>Thank You</strong></p>
